1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,960
foreign

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,979
about Vice news remember Vice news

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,119
I know they don't matter

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,400
I allowed them to come and do a piece on

5
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,620
me in the war room

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,600
about seven months ago now

7
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,580
I knew it would be eight piece of course

8
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,380
I'm a professional but I also knew

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,540
anyone with a brain would see through

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,290
the hit Peaks and see the beauty of the

11
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,120
worm and want to join so I allowed them

12
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,040
to come to a hit piece

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,930
and then

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,960
I got interviewed by Piers Morgan I'll

15
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,879
look for calling

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,620
it's our friends from Vice but he can

17
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,420
wait

18
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,640
then I interviewed by Piers Morgan and

19
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:05,519
he came at me hard and all of the

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,518
comments are saying bro takes a g The

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,070
Matrix tries to tell the world that

22
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,500
everyone hates me but the truth is

23
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,600
everyone actually loves me so when peers

24
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,840
tried to come for me hard expecting to

25
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,080
be a hero he was actually attacked and

26
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,780
he felt like oops I made a mistake which

27
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,620
stopped Vice releasing their hit piece

28
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:25,460
because they called me and said hey

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,438
don't call him

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,350
he called me that hey we want to film

31
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,510
some more we feel like we didn't get the

32
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,640
other side of the story basically we

33
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,040
want to undo the hit piece and do the

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,760
fair journalism we were supposed to do

35
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,799
in the first place because now we

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,020
realize making a hit piece on you

37
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,640
doesn't work out well for us

38
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,680
then I went to jail because I'm Matrix

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,430
attacked and they thought ah he's a bad

40
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:49,230
guy now we can do a hit piece and they

41
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,030
released a hit piece and nobody believed

42
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,520
it just like I said everyone saw through

43
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,439
it salt was garbage to the point where

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,840
Vice had to turn the comments off

45
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:01,079
because everyone was insulting them they

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,820
even falsely edited me stuttering what

47
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,500
have you ever seen me stutter on any

48
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,020
video ever to try and make me look

49
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,060
frustrated like I've been caught out by

50
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,140
this dork called Matt

51
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,360
so they released the hit piece and it

52
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,670
was totally detrimental for them nobody

53
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,770
believed them bombed their reputation

54
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,480
even worse Vice used to be something and

55
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,370
now they're completely off the deep end

56
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,000
nobody gives a [ __ ] about them complete

57
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,520
Matrix propaganda

58
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,190
so then I get released from jail

59
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,859
and now Matt from Vice is begging me

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,039
begging me for another interview

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,399
calling me every day begging me

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,499
please please please

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,529
so I've decided because I'm such a nice

64
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,099
man most people have

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,679
an organization anymore but I'm so nice

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,650
I'm gonna have a conversation with Vice

67
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,810
news we're gonna talk today

68
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,180
we're going to talk to Matt let me

69
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,800
message him

70
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,140
again I said an instruction

71
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,880
again

72
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,830
like a little dog

73
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,900
so wait for Matt to call us and we're

74
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,239
gonna hear what Matt has to say about

75
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,860
the fact that they were dishonest

76
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:12,900
and they weren't particularly good at oh

77
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,000
look

78
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,098
again please Mr

79
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,060
Geeks

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,179
well if it isn't Mac

81
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,458
Andrew hey

82
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,140
Mr honest journalism

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,050
it's a shame nobody else thinks of you

84
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,760
that way Matt that's why you have to

85
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,000
- turn off the comments on your little
- video

86
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:41,002


87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,200
hey are you at home

88
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,219
congrats on your being released under uh

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,539
house arrest thank you

90
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,860
what do you think is is next

91
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,679
well

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,079
it's a beautiful reality Matt

93
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,140
it's a beautiful life and I'm clearly

94
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,030
one of God's chosen ones

95
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,220
and I'm here to spread a positive

96
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,740
message and continue with my mission

97
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:19,919
to prevent the degeneracy which is

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,680
purported by organizations like Vice

99
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,180
drug taking

100
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,730
and other forms of pornography a bunch

101
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,560
of other stuff you want are involved in

102
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:31,139
I'm here to combat it I'm going to lead

103
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,300
people to the truth and to the light

104
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:35,699
and we're all going to be better people

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,500
have a better Society for that and I

106
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,360
think you learned that

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,320
when you turn the comments off in your

108
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,000
little video

109
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,100
that most people understand I'm a Force

110
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,020
for good and that hit pieces don't

111
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,520
really work because

112
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,040
you've lost all credibility the

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,039
mainstream Matrix mechanisms of the

114
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,420
media

115
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,960
unfortunately for you

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,800
is that is that your excuse

117
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,660
I want to see whether you were up for

118
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:21,810
doing another interview not revise but

119
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,038
for the BBC

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,100
why would you want to interview me I'm a

121
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:28,940
- bad person I thought according to your
- little uh story

122
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:28,942


123
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,670
I just tried to report both sides of

124
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:38,400
every story so oh you do both sides is

125
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:41,130
that how you think you work

126
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:44,940
well that includes your side as well so

127
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:49,440
you know it was obviously difficult to

128
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,199
interview you while you were in jail now

129
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,890
you're out you know we can actually have

130
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,580
a chance to hear your side of things

131
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,198
problem is Matt

132
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
everyone on the planet wants to

133
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,099
interview me

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,490
so the question is why would I choose

135
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,950
you when I have unlimited offers from

136
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,440
people who are far more successful and

137
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,700
better than you at the jaw

138
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,820
because I'd be doing and I'm not trying

139
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:17,940
to disrespect you I'm being honest I'd

140
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:19,440
be doing you a favor like Matt

141
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,720
what's your last name Shane

142
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,520
that name didn't matter until it was

143
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:25,649
Associated to mine you do an interview

144
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,690
with me you matter for a little bit but

145
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,370
I can do an interview with anyone

146
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,680
so why would I do an interview with you

147
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,430
and this isn't genuinely a question it's

148
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:35,039
not an insult I'm actually asking you

149
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,420
why I would choose you

150
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:38,820
when I have unlimited offers on the

151
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:39,839
table

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,860
because we have a history

153
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,890
we have a history of you doing dishonest

154
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:49,480
journalism on me so I would choose you

155
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,840
interesting

156
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,019
any journalist that you speak to is

157
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,879
going to

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,580
ask you the Sim similar questions the

159
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,480
ones I asked you I have no problem with

160
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,660
your questions

161
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,978
the reason the reason that I want to do

162
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,900
an interview with you and of course you

163
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,920
can do an interview with anyone you want

164
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:14,140
and you know that's entirely your choice

165
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,479
I'm just you know one of the many people

166
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,360
asking you I guess but we have a history

167
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:22,560
and we got cut short last time and there

168
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,630
are still unanswered questions that I

169
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,960
want to put to you I can only tell you

170
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,759
why I want to interview you you know

171
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,110
ultimately it is your choice

172
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,600
it is my choice isn't it I get to choose

173
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,370
which reporter in the world all these

174
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,500
reporters who want to say bad things

175
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,240
about me I get to choose which report

176
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,940
are on the planet gets to become

177
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,680
relevant via proxy because I am the most

178
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,720
relevant person and I get to do the

179
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,580
charitable Act of allowing somebody to

180
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,440
sit next to me and ask me questions

181
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,479
it's kind of interesting I need to think

182
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,180
heavily about it I can't just give out

183
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,800
such a fantastic opportunity to

184
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,539
disingenuous nobodies it's something I

185
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,419
need to think about do you work for the

186
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,599
BBC now or do you work for yourself

187
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,598
I'm an independent contractor but it has

188
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,510
to be broadcast somewhere and I think

189
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,860
the BBC is is where it would go

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,719
but one thing I would say though is

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,538
uh I spoke to the sartorial shooter and

192
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,410
he said that one of the things you might

193
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,379
want is the chance to film it and record

194
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,180
it yourself

195
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,740
Oh you mean so you can't edit in

196
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,460
stutters like you did with Vice to

197
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:28,740
pretend I was stuttering when I was

198
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,120
answering questions is that what is that

199
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,470
why

200
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,080
I don't know what your friends yes you

201
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,240
do Matt the algorithm to make you become

202
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,070
more famous and more viral I'm not an

203
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,840
expert on algorithms for social media

204
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,820
platforms I do not have most of them

205
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,280
installed on my phone I cannot control a

206
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,770
15 year old Singaporean decides to do

207
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,020
when he chops me up and calls me names I

208
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,019
can't control that and I wouldn't try to

209
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,600
when you search for Europe and I

210
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,380
wouldn't try to when you search for your

211
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,800
name in Google what are the associated

212
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,380
terms why then of the Romanian police

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,379
said the investigation is ongoing I'm

214
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,690
not sure where you got that information

215
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:06,660
from I'm not sure who said it is there

216
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,480
some kind of procedure that must be

217
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,640
completed I don't know there has been a

218
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,720
lot of bad sure that must be completed I

219
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,800
don't know there has been a lot of bad

220
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,420
I can't control that and I wouldn't try

221
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:24,720
to when you search for your sure that

222
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,860
- must be completed I don't know there has
- been a lot of bad

223
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:27,862


224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,430
let's be honest with each other we have

225
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:45,100
a history we're friends now don't lie

226
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,950
startups were edited in to try and make

227
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,860
it look like you stumped me with your

228
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,820
- asinine questions which of course is
- absolutely impossible

229
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:52,822


230
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,278
what you might be referring to is

231
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,820
sometimes we cut to b-roll of someone's

232
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,100
face when we're editing an interview

233
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,140
because you know we spoke for almost an

234
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,000
hour but it gets cut down to only a few

235
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,279
minutes so there are going to be some

236
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,959
edits and we are going to cut to your

237
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
face at some point

238
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,420
- um you did you dishonestly edited okay
- we agree

239
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:14,422


240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,040
I would say we don't dishonestly edit it

241
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,870
but the idea that we would just release

242
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:20,940
a you know an hour long unedited entity

243
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,740
it doesn't really make sense right

244
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,930
because of the whole documentary is only

245
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:28,230
45 minutes so anyway but the point is I

246
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,690
can't stop you filming

247
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,700
in your own home you know releasing

248
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,560
whatever you want to release editing it

249
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,420
however you want to edit it you know I

250
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,820
can't stop you doing that so if that's

251
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,100
what you want to do then you obviously

252
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,790
can do it and then you know when people

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,530
say

254
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,480
oh Matt you've unfairly edited this or

255
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,220
whatever you can say well here's the the

256
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,020
full unedited you're right version

257
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,420
you're right I can film our interview to

258
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:53,160
protect myself from your dishonest

259
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,929
journalism I appreciate that thank you

260
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,360
I'm gonna think about it Matt because

261
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm the one who matters here I can sit

262
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,450
down with [ __ ] peer with

263
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,180
Big Bird Oscar the Grouch I can sit down

264
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,820
with anybody it'll be the most viewed

265
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,740
podcast or interview in the world so I'm

266
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,430
gonna think about it that's true would

267
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,270
you would you bring me a box of

268
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,420
chocolates

269
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,119
I can bring you a box of chocolates

270
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,460
if you promise to bring me a box of

271
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,320
chocolates that will increase your

272
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,940
chances and I'll give you an answer

273
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,140
- within 24 hours but you have to promise
- me Matt don't lie to me

274
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:27,142


275
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,720
I'll I'll check with my superiors

276
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,250
whether I can send you a box of

277
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,170
chocolates well then you check with your

278
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,260
boss you go into your boss's room and

279
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,540
ask if you're allowed to spend

280
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,220
a large portion of your salary on a five
